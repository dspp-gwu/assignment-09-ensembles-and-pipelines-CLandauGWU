# Assignment 09: Ensemble models & pipelines
The final homework assignment for our class will introduce you to ensemble models and pipelines. 

An ensemble model combines more than one model to achieve better predictions along some desired metric or set of metrics.  Although there are an infinite number of potential ensemble models, the most commonly used class of ensembles is called a "random forest" model, and it combines many decisions trees (hence the "forest") into an "ensemble" of decision trees, with each tree "voting" for a specific outcome.  

A pipeline combines multiple steps in a data science workflow.  Perhaps the most powerful use of a pipeline is tuning your model over a wide array of possible options using what is know as “grid search”.
